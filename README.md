# NintendoSharp
A C# library and Loader for writing programs to interface with Nintendo products over USB/Serial ports. Currently, it should work on most Arduino Boards. In the future, it will also support custom I2C ports and Raspberry Pi boards.

It uses a modified version of the "Nintendo" Arduino library (https://github.com/NicoHood/Nintendo) and works with most Arduino boards.
