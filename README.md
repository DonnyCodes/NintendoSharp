# NintendoSharp
A C# library and Loader for writing programs to interface with Nintendo products over USB/Serial ports. Currently, it should work on most Arduino boards(https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products). In the future, it will also support custom I2C ports and Raspberry Pi boards.

It uses a modified version of NicoHood's "Nintendo" library (https://github.com/NicoHood/Nintendo) to interact with a console's controller port over digital I/O pins. If you want to emulate a Wii Remote or Wii U Gamepad, a Bluetooth card is required in your PC (USB Bluetooth cards work too).
